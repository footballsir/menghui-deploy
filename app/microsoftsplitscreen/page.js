Split screen allows people to view 2 tabs in one screen, It is key for our vision to make Edge browser like system platform. From launch, split screen is the most well rated feature in Edge ever, and drove incredible business impact for a gain of 0.4% market share and about 80 million dollars. In this case study, we’ll walk through it from ground up to several rounds of iterations.</div>

                        <div className='h1 max-w-3xl'>Ground up the concept, be inclusive - develop for All users not just Microsoft users</div>
                        <div className='p1 mt-10 max-w-3xl'>The initial concept came from one of Edge leaders, who wants to help Microsoft Office users to view documents side by side, the idea was to provide value between Microsoft products for growth. However, when I joined the project, we pivoted the direction from just for Office users to all web users. I believe as a platform it’s our responsibility to build for all users not just Microsoft users. </div>
                        <div className='p1 mt-10 max-w-3xl'>For all Edge users we empower them for 2 scenarios:
                            <br />1. Open a link in split screen from the current page to stay in context.
                            <br />2. Merge two tabs to view side by side.
                            <br />And when we build the concept and flight in Edge beta, it proved great success.</div>

                        <div className='p1 mt-10 max-w-3xl'>To solve the low conversion problem. The first lesson we learned is we design the user journey too specific. Imagine what’s the most common behavior for user when they open a new tab in browser, it’s interacting with the address bar! However in split screen we totally removed the address bar on starting page. So our first iteration generalizes the use cases by adding back the address bar, open new tab page and so on.</div>

                        <div className='p1 mt-10 max-w-3xl'>After shipping for a while, we discovered that the daily active users for the feature are relatively low. The biggest reason is that people think it’s very hard for them to remember using this feature. And we start to think what’s the most intuitive way for users? What might a child interacts with this feature? They would just grab 2 things and put them together right? So we have drag and drop.</div>

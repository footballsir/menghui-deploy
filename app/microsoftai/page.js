                        <div className='p1 mt-10 max-w-3xl'>In 2023 the wave of GPT stormed tech industry. AI is very important not only for Microsoft products but also the way we work. When it first came out I took the chance to develop prompt engineering. I developed a Figma plugin helped 500+ Microsoft designers, engineers, product managers in China and US to better conduct user research by giving creating discussion guide and research templates.</div>

                        <div className='p1 mt-10 max-w-3xl'>I soon realized that prior data is a unique value for AI to search and retrieve. At Microsoft we have thousands of data and research that has been conducted. I talked to lots of fellows inside the company, they complain that at many times their assumptions or hypothesis are already resolved in previous findings did by someone else, they just did not know it exists. This time I build a teams application that gathers all research data in Microsoft, so people can talk to it to quickly learn about everything that has been done before.</div>
